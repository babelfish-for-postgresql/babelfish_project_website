We’re excited to announce Babelfish 2.1.0, which makes it easier than ever to adopt Babelfish.  Our users have asked us to make Babelfish easier to use, and we’ve responded with a feature-packed release.  After installing 2.1.0, you can browse database tables and column types with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  This release also adds support for creating roles on the TDS port with the CREATE ROLE command, and improves cross-database reference support for queries.

We’re happy to announce that Babelfish delivers on these user requests, as well as others. You can see the full list of improvements in the [release notes](https://babelfishpg.org/docs/versions/babelfish-1-2-0.html).  As always, build directions for Babelfish and its prerequisites, along with Babelfish source distributions for 2.1.0 can be found in the [babelfish-for-postgresql repository](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish-for-postgresql/releases/tag/BABEL_2_1_0__PG_14_3).

We hope you relish the benefits and improved usability of the new Babelfish 2.1.0!
