The Babelfish for PostgreSQL project continues to move forward. Recently, important capabilities were added in Babelfish 1.2.0, including support for ROWVERSION, easier logins with SSMS, and better JSON support with JSON_QUERY.  To review the long list of improvements, [see the release notes](https://babelfishpg.org/docs/versions/babelfish-1-2-0.html).

Build directions for Babelfish and its prerequisites, along with Babelfish source distributions for 1.2.0 can be found in [the *babelfish-for-postgresql* repository](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish-for-postgresql/releases/tag/BABEL_1_2_0__PG_13_6). 

Enjoy and stay tuned!
