The basic idea of the Babelfish feature of PostgreSQL is to provide Microsoft SQL Server
compatibility for PostgreSQL. Providing a high-degree of compatibility to applications
specifically designed for Microsoft SQL Server helps customers reduce the effort required to
modify these applications to run on PostgreSQL, enabling faster, cheaper, and lower risk
migrations. Babelfish provides compatibility to Microsoft SQL Server database applications
along multiple dimensions.
