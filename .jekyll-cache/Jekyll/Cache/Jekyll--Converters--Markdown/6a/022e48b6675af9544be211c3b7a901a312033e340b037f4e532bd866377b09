<p><b>Add Single Sign-On (SSO) to Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Using SAML and Okta</b></p>

<p>by Jagadeesh Pusapadi, Aug 16 2019</p>

<p>Open Distro for Elasticsearch Security implements the web browser single sign-on (SSO) profile of the SAML 2.0 protocol. This enables you to configure federated access with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider (IdP). In a prior post, I discussed setting up SAML-based SSO using Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). In this post, Iâ€™ll cover the Okta-specific configuration.</p>

<p><b>Demystifying Elasticsearch Shard Allocation</b></p>

<p>by Vigya Sharma and Jon Handler, Aug 13 2019</p>

<p>At the core of Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€™s ability to provide a seamless scaling experience, lies its ability distribute its workload across machines. This is achieved via sharding. When you create an index you set a primary and replica shard count for that index. Elasticsearch distributes your data and requests across those shards, and the shards across your data nodes.</p>

<p><b>Use Elasticsearchâ€™s rollover API For Efficient Storage Distribution</b></p>

<p>by Jon Handler, Aug 06 2019</p>

<p>Many Open Distro for Elasticsearch users manage data life cycle in their clusters by creating an index based on a standard time period, usually one index per day. This pattern has many advantages - ingest tools like Logstash support index rollover out of the box; defining a retention window is straightforward; and deleting old data is as simple as dropping an index.</p>

<p><b>Manage Your Open Distro for Elasticsearch Alerting Monitors With odfe-monitor-cli</b></p>

<p>by Mihir Soni, Jun 12 2019</p>

<p>When you use Open Distro for Elasticsearch Alerting, you create monitors in Kibana. Setting up monitors with a UI is fast and convenient, making it easy to get started. If monitoring is a major workload for your cluster, though, you may have hundreds or even thousands of monitors to create, update, and tune over time. Setting so many monitors using the Kibana UI would be time-consuming and tedious.</p>

<p><b>Set up Multi-Tenant Kibana Access in Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b></p>

<p>by Jon Handler, Jun 04 2019</p>

<p>Elasticsearch has become a default choice for storing and analyzing log data to deliver insights on your applicationâ€™s performance, your security stance, and your usersâ€™ interactions with your application. Itâ€™s so useful that many teams adopt Elasticsearch early in their development cycle to support DevOps. This grass-roots adoption often mushrooms into a confusing set of clusters and users across a large organization.</p>

<p><b>New! Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€™s Job Scheduler Plugin</b></p>

<p>by Alolita Sharma and Jon Handler, May 29 2019</p>

<p>Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€™s JobScheduler plugin provides a framework for developers to accomplish common, scheduled tasks on their cluster. You can implement Job Schedulerâ€™s Service Provider Interface (SPI) to take snapshots, manage your dataâ€™s lifecycle, run periodic jobs, and much more. When you use Job Scheduler, you build a plugin that implements interfaces provided in the Job Scheduler library.</p>

<p><b>Store Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€™s Performance Analyzer Output in Elasticsearch</b></p>

<p>by Jon Handler, May 25 2019</p>

<p>Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€˜s Performance Analyzer plugin exposes a REST API that returns metrics from your Elasticsearch cluster. To get the most out of these metrics, you can store them in Elasticsearch and use Kibana to visualize them. While you can use Open Distro for Elasticsearchâ€™s PerfTop to build visualizations, PerfTop doesnâ€™t retain data and is meant to be lightweight.</p>

<p><b>Use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to Authenticate in Open Distro for Elasticsearch and Kibana</b></p>

<p>by Neeraj Prashar and Jon Handler, May 23 2019</p>

<p>Token-based authentication systems are popular in the world of web services. They provide many benefits, including (but not limited to) security, scalability, statelessness, and extensibility. With Amazonâ€™s Open Distro for Elasticsearch, users now have an opportunity to take advantage of the numerous security features included in the Security plugin. One such feature is the ability to authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for a single sign-on experience.</p>

<p><b>Run Rally with Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b></p>

<p>by Atri Sharma and Jon Handler, May 09 2019</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to size and scale an Elasticsearch cluster. You need to have sufficient storage for your data, but your mappings and the contents of the data are key components to your dataâ€™s size on disk. You need capacity for your queries and updates, but the amounts of CPU, JVM, disk, and network bandwidth you use are critically dependent on the queries you run and the updates you send.</p>

<p><b>Lightweight Debugging with Performance Analyzer and PerfTop in Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b></p>

<p>by Jon Handler, Apr 12 2019</p>

<p>When you want to monitor your Elasticsearch cluster or debug an issue, you have a number of choices. You can use the various cat and stats APIs to pull information out of the cluster. You can monitor and profile the JVM itself. These options can be cumbersome, and they lack visual displays. While you could push cat and stats data back into Elasticsearch and visualize with Kibana, sometimes you want a more lightweight method.</p>

<p><b>Set an Alert in Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b></p>

<p>by Jon Handler, Apr 03 2019</p>

<p>One of Elasticsearchâ€™s primary use cases is log analytics - you collect logs from your infrastructure, transform each log line into JSON documents, and send those documents to Elasticsearchâ€™s bulk API. A transformed log line contains many fields, each containing values.</p>
