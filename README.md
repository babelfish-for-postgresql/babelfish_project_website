### Building the Website

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can build the site and make it available on a local server via `docker-compose up -d`, or by installing all the dependencies on your local environment as follows.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), then run `bundle install`.
2. Build and start Jekyll with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
3. Browse the site at [`http://127.0.0.1:4000/`](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

Alternatively, build the site with `bundle exec jekyll build`. The HTML output is generated into `/_site`. For the full configuration options when running Jekyll, see [this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/).

### Testing

#### Link checker

We use a link checker plugin to ensure that we don't have any broken links on the website. It does not run by default since it can slow down the build, especially when running `bundle exec jekyll serve`. To run the link checker, add the ENV flag `JEKYLL_LINK_CHECKER` or `JEKYLL_FATAL_LINK_CHECKER` with any one of the valid values `internal`,`forced`,`all` or `retry`. Each option tests a larger range of links. E.g.

```sh
JEKYLL_FATAL_LINK_CHECKER=all bundle exec jekyll build
```

**`JEKYLL_LINK_CHECKER` vs `JEKYLL_FATAL_LINK_CHECKER`**

They both accept the same values with the only difference being that `JEKYLL_FATAL_LINK_CHECKER` fails the build if a broken link is found

**Env values**

1. **internal**: validates only the internal links
2. **forced**: validates internal links and links that are technically internal but instead link to an external page. e.g. `/docs`
3. **all**: validates all links. however this option does not retry retry-able link or follow redirection links. e.g. HTTP:429 (too many attempts, retry after), HTTP:301 (Permanent redirect)
4. **retry**: validates all the links but also retries links with retry-able HTTP header
