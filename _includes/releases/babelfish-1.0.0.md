This is the initial release of Babelfish for PostgreSQL.  Babelfish for PostgreSQL is an open-source project that allows PostgreSQL to understand queries from applications written for Microsoft SQL Server. Babelfish understands the SQL Server wire-protocol and T-SQL, the SQL Server query language, so you donâ€™t have to switch database drivers or re-write all of your application queries. With Babelfish, applications currently running on SQL Server can run directly on PostgreSQL with fewer code changes.

Babelfish for PostgreSQL is open-source software that uses the Apache License version 2 (ALv2) and the PostgreSQL License. The source for the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql).
