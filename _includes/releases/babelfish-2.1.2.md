## Overview

Babelfish 2.1.2 contains the functionality and features of versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1, as well as:

- a fix for critical issues in Babelfish due to incorrect handling of user input for some application features.
- a fix for error handling in sp_prepare calls which can cause a server crash when a large number of parameters are sent by the application. Babelfish currently supports a maximum of 100 parameters for a procedure or function.
- a fix for error handling in SSL/TLS handshake for some client drivers.


Babelfish does not support an upgrade path to version 2.1.2 from Babelfish 1.x.x. Use the following command to check the version of Babelfish that you have installed:

```sql
babelfish_db[124386]# SELECT sys.serverProperty('BabelfishVersion') AS BabelfishVersion;
 babelfishversion 
------------------
 2.1.2
