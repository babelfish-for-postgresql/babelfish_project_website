## Contributing code

Babelfish is available as Open Source software and can be downloaded from Github
for free under the terms of the
[Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and the
[PostgreSQL license](https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/).

The project is open to contributions. Simple send a [pull request via
Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
and contribute to Babelfish.

Please make sure that some of the basic requirements are met:

### Coding conventions

It's important to follow coding conventions. Check out the
[community standards](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/source.html) and
make sure your code conforms to the requirements. Following conventions eases the burden of
maintenance, and make the code more readable for other community members.


### Testing and quality management

Make sure that your code is properly tested. Babelfish comes with a standard
test suite which covers a variety of scenarios. Changes made to the code should
not break existing features. We strongly recommend running the standard tests
before you send a pull request to development. 


### Documentation and help

If you add new features, you also need to add tests for functionality.
Patches that do not contain tests for new features will not be accepted by the
community. The same is true for missing documentation. Documenting your feature
is as important as having working code. That's why we encourage people to properly document
their code. If you are having language troubles, or if you need help, we recommend
reaching out to the community for help via Github.

For most new features, it is generally a good idea to provide working examples.
This is especially true for programming interfaces and new SQL functions. 


### Code review

If you are not a coder yourself, or if you don't want to write your own patch, we
are also very happy to find people who can review existing code and point to
mistakes or other problems. Positive feedback is highly appreciated, and we are
happy if people help us to detect bugs and find other problems such as typos in
the documentation. 

To help with code review, simply check out 
[Github](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish) 
and help with the review process. 


### Avoiding license violations

If you contribute code, make sure that you are not violating 3rd party rights.
Checking for IP violations beforehand is therefore not only a good idea; it is also expected by
the community. We want Babelfish to be free of 3rd party claims and we want to
protect our users from such claims. Keeping the code clean is therefore a good
idea, and benefits the community as well as all those users out there.
