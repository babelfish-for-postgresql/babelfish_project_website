# Babelfish for PostgreSQL documentation

This site contains the technical documentation for [Babelfish for PostgreSQL](https://babelfishpg.org/), an [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/) open-source project that adds a Microsoft SQL Server-compatible end-point to PostgreSQL. With the addition of Babelfish, PostgreSQL understands T-SQL, SQL Server's proprietary SQL dialect, and supports the TDS communication protocol, so applications originally written for SQL Server may work with PostgreSQL with fewer code changes and without changing database drivers.

## Why use Babelfish for PostgreSQL?

Babelfish for PostgreSQL may help in the following use cases:

* When transitioning your SQL Server compatible source code to an open-source based database.
* When moving away from proprietary or legacy applications that don't make source code available.

Babelfish for PostgreSQL functionality is distributed in five components:

Component | Purpose
:--- | :---
[Babelfish Server Patch](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish) | Enables Babelfish hooks for PostgreSQL.
[Babelfish TDS Extension](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/tree/BABEL_1_0_0/contrib/babelfishpg_tds) | TDS - provides a secondary endpoint that speaks the TDS (SQL Server) network protocol.
[Babelfish Language Extension](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/tree/BABEL_1_0_0/contrib/babelfishpg_tsql) | Provides a procedural language compatible with T-SQL (Uses ANTLR parser).
[Babelfish Money Type](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/tree/BABEL_1_0_0/contrib/babelfishpg_money) | Supports the money type in SQL Server. This is a variation of the open-source fixed-decimal extension.
[Babelfish Common](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/tree/BABEL_1_0_0/contrib/babelfishpg_common) | Supports the various datatypes in SQL Server.
